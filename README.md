DeepFreeze
==========

This is a Kerbal Space Program mod intended to allow players to remove a kerbal from being affected 
by other mods such as Life Support Mods, Acheivement mods or Fitness Mods.

This is a forked version from ScottPalandin, who has given his blessing for me to continue development of DeepFreeze on this fork as he does not have the time to continue his work on the mod himself.
His original code can be found in the link below and was licensed as per below, 
as such this forked version continues to be licensed the same.
