title = CRY-2300 Cryonic Freezing Chamber
manufacturer = REPOSoftTech
description = Designed for long term storage of up to 10 kerbals. The CRY-2300 uses Glykerol and ElectricCharge to freeze or thaw one Kerbal.
Please ensure you have enough ElectricCharge capacity on your ship. The CRY-2300 comes stocked with 50 units of Glykerol.
CAUTION: The CRY-2300 also requires ElectricCharge per minute per Kerbal to keep it's Monitoring Systems Functioning. If it cannot get this ElectricCharge 
there is a risk of frozen Kerbals dying.
